This outlines the means to generate CRSS data:
P.S. The flow is correct however depending on your machine the path may be adjusted for the files
on which the scripts will be running. Should be pretty straightforward

### running the PX CP-FFT simulations:

./run.random.iCER.HOME.sh


### postprocessing

./run.sh

### generating plots like the paper:

./scripts/postProcessing_for_plots/data.sh
./scripts/postProcessing_for_plots/RMS.sh         # for accuracy
./scripts/postProcessing_for_plots/StdDev.sh         # for precision

### Plotting:
./scripts/postProcessing_for_plots/New_CRSS_plot.sh  ## this will generate the plots 

###Finally to generate the distribution plots:

./scripts/postProcessing_for_plots/Results_all_MeanStd_RMS.sh
./scripts/postProcessing_for_plots/AccuracyPrecision_plots.sh
